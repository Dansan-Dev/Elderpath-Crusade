### Overview
Elderpath Crusade is a turn-based roguelike strategy game where every decision matters. Explore a contested forest, recruit and train units, capture territory, and lead your people to survive an encroaching crusade.

But the rival tribe, [INSERT ENEMY TRIBE NAME], has launched a crusade, sweeping through neighboring lands and shattering the peace. Now itâ€™s conquer or be conquered.
