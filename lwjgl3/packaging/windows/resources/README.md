# Forest of Dreams — Windows Package Guide

Welcome! This archive contains the Forest of Dreams desktop build for Windows (x64). This document explains how to run the game and how to pin it to Start and the taskbar.


## Contents of this ZIP
- ForestOfDreams.exe (the application)
- Game runtime files and assets required to play
- README.md (this file)


## Quick start
1) Extract the ZIP to a folder you control (for example: Desktop\ForestOfDreams-windows-x64\).
2) Double‑click ForestOfDreams.exe to start the game.

That’s it — no installer is required.


## Creating shortcuts
- Desktop shortcut:
  1) Right‑click ForestOfDreams.exe
  2) Choose “Show more options” (if needed) → “Send to” → “Desktop (create shortcut)”

- Pin to Start:
  1) Right‑click ForestOfDreams.exe
  2) Click “Pin to Start”

- Pin to taskbar:
  1) Drag the ForestOfDreams.exe file onto the taskbar


## Running from any location
You can keep the folder anywhere (e.g., Documents, a separate Games folder, or an external drive). If you move the folder, update or recreate any shortcuts you made.


## Updating the game
- Download the new ZIP, extract it, and replace the old folder.
- If you pinned the app to Start/taskbar and moved the folder, you may need to re‑pin it.


## Troubleshooting
- If Windows shows a SmartScreen prompt, choose “More info” → “Run anyway”.
- If double‑clicking does nothing, try running ForestOfDreams.exe from a Command Prompt to see error messages.
- Some antivirus tools may scan the app on first launch; this can delay startup briefly.
